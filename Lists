List contains elements of different data types and same data types:

synatx: A=['newting',2,2.33]
It contains many datatypes in one data structure.

I also supports slicing same in case of strings.
'Slicingis also supported:
my_list[:1] or
[1:] start with the element at index 1 and goes upto end of string.





Some of the operations that can be used in a list are as under:

my_list.reverse()
my_list.append(5)
my_list.sort()
my_list.pop()
put value in paranthases to 
apply operation on that particular element.
