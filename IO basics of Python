Input output basics.

Files:
audio files, excel documents and many more.But libraries are also required.
steps to create a test file using jupiter notebooks.

Steps:

Write a file (make a new file):

%%writefile myfile.txt
myfile= open('myfile.txt')

to know where is your jupter note book: pwd

now how to read that file:

myfile= open('myfile.txt')
myfile.read()

but if you  use myfile.read() you will get an empty space because 
it will take the cursor to end of the file so inorder to  
reset it again use the below command:


myfile.seek(0)<--

it will again take the cursor to the start of the file.

then we can use the myfile.read() again.

sometimes it is helpful in lists.
 if you want to read it line by line then:
  myfile.readline()
  
  if you wan to open a file that is present at any location in your system.
  but you need to complete file path 
  
  For example: (c:\\user\\ so on just the diff is that you need to pace \\ instead of\
  
  Beat practises.:
  once you open a file you need to close it also:
  
  myfile.close()
  if you dont want to close it manually:
   
with open('myfile.txt') as my_new_file:

content =my_new_file.read()

writing or overwritying the file:

with open('myfile.txt and then we can shift+tab to get its documentation.)


with open('myfile.txt',mode='r' ) as myfile:
    
    Contents = myfile.read()
Successful.

with open('myfile.txt',mode='w' ) as myfile:
    
    Contents = myfile.read()
    
    it show error because of the permissions.
    
    So for that wen need to follow the following steps:
    
    
    
    myfile=(open('myfile.txt'))
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    misc:
    mode=
    r
    w
    a-append
    r+ reading and writing
    w+ writing and reading  overwrites an exixting file or create a new file.
    ---------
'r'       open for reading (default)
'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
'x'       create a new file and open it for writing
'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
'b'       binary mode
't'       text mode (default)
'+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
'U'       universal newline mode (deprecated)
